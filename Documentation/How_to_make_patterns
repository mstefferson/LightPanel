How to make patterns:

All patterns should be classes in ./src/patterns/functioning_patterns.
When you make a pattern, in order for it to be called by the pattern_master.py file, it needs to be called by its call_name in pattern_master.py
The way animation works is that the pattern_master.py will just loop over and over calling your pattern function, and then pushing that pixel array object to the appropriate output
It may be handy to keep track of the real time since start if your pattern needs that. Don't assume the refresh rate

Your pattern generator should return a pixel array of the appropriate size based on the panel object's m and n
If you make a new pattern py file make sure to create an intializer and call it in pattern_master.
For example active_pattern = TestPatterns( my_panel.m, my_panel.n ) build the pattern size from the panel

When generating the pixel array objects the following variables are handy :
panel.m: number of rows
panel.n: number of columns
