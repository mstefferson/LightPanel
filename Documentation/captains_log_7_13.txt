Notes From Steve To Mike Jul 13:
Need to set things up to take in args and then make selective imports based on that.
Key files are :
patterns/panel_patterns_starter.py - needs to selectively import the visualizer
pattern_master.py - needs to selectively import the NeoPixels

to call my stuff you need to call pattern_master.py [visualizer name ] [pi or vis].
The defaults are vis and "test". worm is probably the most interesting visualizer.

This branch doesn't run:
%%%%
> python pattern_master.py worm vis

Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "pattern_master.py", line 6, in <module>
        from neopixel import *
      File "/Users/mike/Projects/LightPanel/neopixel.py", line 5, in <module>
        import _rpi_ws281x as ws
    ImportError: No module named _rpi_ws281x

%%%%%%

I am going to comment classes in Developement branch until this can run.
