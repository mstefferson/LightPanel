Notes From Steve To Mike Jul 13:
Need to set things up to take in args and then make selective imports based on that.
Key files are :
patterns/panel_patterns_starter.py - needs to selectively import the visualizer
pattern_master.py - needs to selectively import the NeoPixels

to call my stuff you need to call pattern_master.py [visualizer name ] [pi or vis].
The defaults are vis and "test". worm is probably the most interesting visualizer.
