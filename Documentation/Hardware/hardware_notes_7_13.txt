Hardware notes: 

5 meters for $23. That’s 150 LEDs = $0.154 / LED
5m, $20 : https://www.amazon.com/BTF-LIGHTING-Flexible-Individually-Addressable-Non-waterproof/dp/B01CDTECSG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1509991990&sr=8-2&keywords=WS2812+5m#Ask 
Can get double density for $30 on sale too

an octagon is roughly .83 * the area of a square of the same width
a 2ft square octagon therefore is ~270 LEDs = $42
a meter square octagon is 747 LEDs = $115

we’re going with 2’ x 2’ octagon for the first panel. This is essentially 2 5 meter strips. I should verify standard particle board sizes.
We will need to make 18 strips to put along the panel. the shortest strip is 7, and the longest is 18

If we do a 2’x2’ square w/ ~1led/inch we need 24 2’ strips = 48’ = 15m
 

OUTER PERIMETER (6.6ft)
Total perimeter of the above is :
if a is the length of each part of the octagon, the full width is 2.42a. so for our octagon a = .823ft, and the total perimeter is 8a = 6.58ft

We will want some kind of picture frame material. For the outer edge, probably something like these:

MAIN BODY/BACK
For the main back we can easily buy boards in 2 x 4 sizes :

DIFFUSIVE TOP COVERING
not as easy- things are much more expensive in this range. Corrugated plastic sheeting may be our best bet here. Another tricky thing is standing the material off from the LEDs to make them more diffuse


This stuff’s cheap but probably shitty - http://www.homedepot.com/p/24-in-x-36-in-x-0-157-in-Natural-Twin-Wall-Plastic-Sheet-1TW3624C/205828979
