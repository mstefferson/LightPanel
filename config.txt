# LED strip configuration:
LED_COUNT      = 30      # Number of LED pixels.
# GPIO pin connected to the pixels 
# (18 uses PWM!), (10 uses SPI /dev/spidev0.0) 
LED_PIN        = 18      
LED_FREQ_HZ    = 800000  # LED signal frequency in hertz (usually 800khz)
LED_DMA        = 5       # DMA channel to use for generating signal (try 5)
LED_BRIGHTNESS = 255     # Set to 0 for darkest and 255 for brightest
# Invert LED flag (true/false in json)
# True to invert the signal (when using NPN transistor level shift) 
LED_INVERT     = false   
LED_CHANNEL    = 0       # set to '1' for GPIOs 13, 19, 41, 45 or 53
